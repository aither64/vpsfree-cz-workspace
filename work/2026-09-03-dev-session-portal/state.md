# 2026-09-03-dev-session-portal

## Repositories

- Coordination workspace: branch `2026-09-03-dev-session-portal` in
  `/home/aither/workspace/ai/vpsfree.cz/worktrees/2026-09-03-dev-session-portal/workspace`
- `vpsfree-cz-configuration`: branch `2026-09-03-dev-session-portal` in
  `/home/aither/workspace/ai/vpsfree.cz/worktrees/2026-09-03-dev-session-portal/vpsfree-cz-configuration`

## Status

- Portal service, `dev-session` integration, PKI helper, tests, documentation,
  handoff skill, and workspace branch policy are implemented on the dedicated
  workspace feature branch.
- Current Codex thread registered as
  `01a0678c-baae-7600-bcf6-9a0cb6c83232` and named after the initiative.
- Configuration worktree created from `origin/master` at
  `57d7c12a2da78d334d338a0e56dd7438376a6973`.
- Workspace changes are committed and pushed on
  `2026-09-03-dev-session-portal` through `2c9112da`. At the user's direction,
  published `master` was force-reset from `ada6db0` to its pre-initiative
  commit `0d2802f`; no portal implementation remains on `master`.
- Configuration changes are committed and pushed on
  `2026-09-03-dev-session-portal` through `cc33b7ae`. The branch has three
  commits on top of current `origin/master`.
- The top-level checkout already contained unrelated changes, including a
  modification to `AGENTS.md`; it remains preserved outside this initiative's
  staged patch.

## Commands run

- `bin/dev-session current`
- `bin/dev-session start dev-session-portal --no-attach --no-codex`
- Read-only inspection of the workspace, Codex CLI/App Server interfaces, and
  current aitherdev/internal-DNS configuration.
- `ruby test/dev_session_test.rb`
- `ruby test/workspace_pki_test.rb`
- `CGO_ENABLED=0 go test ./...`
- `CGO_ENABLED=0 go vet ./...`
- `workspace-portal thread create` and `thread set-name` against the live Unix
  App Server socket.
- Skill validation through a Nix Python environment with PyYAML.
- `confctl inputs channel update --commit workspace-tools vpsfree-workspace`
- `confctl inputs channel set --commit workspace-tools vpsfree-workspace d45b5e914434a93859b039f057b4b84750a4c5fa`
- Nix build of `packages/workspace-portal` from the pinned flake input.
- `named-checkzone vpsfree.cz /dev/stdin` with the internal DNS placeholder
  expanded for `ns1.int.prg.vpsfree.cz`.
- Created and pushed the workspace feature branch and its dedicated worktree,
  then force-reset `master` to `0d2802f` as explicitly requested.
- Cancelled the first mandatory-review run because its review packet became
  stale when the workspace history and worktree layout changed.
- Rebased the workspace feature branch onto the tracking-only `master`, dropped
  duplicate tracking commits, and force-pushed the rewritten feature history.
- `confctl inputs channel set --commit workspace-tools vpsfree-workspace 6371e9cad7dec81791a5eb3bf6290aef632dce0d`
- `confctl inputs channel set --commit workspace-tools vpsfree-workspace 2c9112daa50f74dab50ab8983323d040d246f62e`
- Rewrote the unmerged workspace branch into separate portal, final PKI,
  shared-session, and workspace-policy commits.
- Regenerated the final workspace input pin with `confctl` from the clean input
  commit, then rewrote the unmerged configuration branch so it contains one
  generated input update instead of three successive revisions.
- Re-ran both Ruby suites, all Go tests, `go vet`, the handoff-skill
  validator, `git diff --check`, and `nix flake check --no-build` after the
  workspace history rewrite.
- Built `packages/workspace-portal` from the final pinned workspace revision
  with Nix; output:
  `/nix/store/h05r1jlqydflyrn36xgd2g49m8fj8505-workspace-portal-0.1.0`.

## Results

- Active slug: `2026-09-03-dev-session-portal`
- Managed tmux session created as `$36`.
- User confirmed the portal hostname, custom-CA HTTPS, browser-created empty
  sessions with an initial Codex turn, encrypted CA custody on aitherdev, and
  user-owned deployment of aitherdev and both internal DNS servers.
- `dev-session` suite: 83 tests and 700 assertions passed.
- PKI suite: 2 tests and 25 assertions passed, including encrypted-key,
  renewal, hostname, chain, permission, and git-worktree refusal checks.
- Portal Go tests and `go vet` passed.
- The `dev-session-handoff` skill passes the skill creator validator.
- The current ChatGPT desktop SSH session uses the same Unix App Server socket
  that the portal adapter successfully connected to.
- The pinned Nix package builds and its packaged portal, `dev-session`, and PKI
  commands start successfully.
- Internal zone validation passes with serial `2026090300`.
- `nix flake check --no-build --show-trace` passes.
- No GitHub Actions runs are configured for the pushed configuration feature
  branch.
- Workspace `master` and `origin/master` were both reset to `0d2802f`; the
  complete implementation is retained on the pushed workspace feature branch.
  Tracking-only commits now follow that pre-initiative revision on `master`
  without carrying the implementation.

## Open questions

- Mandatory change review must be restarted after quick checks; the long
  `confctl build` validation follows review.
- Live ChatGPT macOS/mobile discovery remains an optional deployment smoke test
  because it depends on the installed clients. The VPN portal is the supported
  browser path regardless of native discovery.

## Cleanup

- Keep the tmux session and configuration worktree until implementation,
  review, and deployment handoff are complete.
- Do not finalize until no review, CI, merge, user deployment handoff, or local
  cleanup remains.
